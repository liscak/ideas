1. Use GPT-2, GPT-3 or other Transformer based models as scripting language in games. 
Explanation: you write a game script(the logic) in english(or other language) and the transformer based model converts the english text to code that the game will execute.
For example: "The animal moved to the left." would move the animal on screen by one block(or some other unit) to the left(on the screen or map, etc)
