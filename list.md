1. Use GPT-2, GPT-3, BERT or other Transformer based models to convert natural language to scripting language in games. 
Explanation: you write a game script(the logic) in english(or other language) and the transformer based model converts the english text to code that the game will execute.
For example: "The animal moved to the left." would move the animal on screen by one block(or some other unit) to the left(on the screen or map, etc)  
TEXT --> CODE(javascript, luascript, python, etc.) --> Execution.
2. Use GPT-2, GPT-3, BERT or other Transformer based models to convert code from one programming language to another programming language.
For example convert Python code to equivalent Javascript code, where the output and side effects of functions are identical.
2. Use GPT-2, GPT-3, BERT or other Transformer based models to convert programming language code to binary code(executable) and vice versa(binary code to programming language code)
