1. Use GPT-2, GPT-3, BERT or other Transformer based models to convert natural language to scripting language in games. 
Explanation: you write(or generate) a game script(the logic) in english(or other language) and the transformer based model converts the english text to code that the game will execute.
For example: "The animal moved to the left." would move the animal on screen by one block(or some other unit) to the left(on the screen or map, etc)  
TEXT --> CODE(javascript, luascript, python, etc.) --> Execution.
Text would be used as input for the transformer based model and the output from the model would be the game script and the game script would be executed by the game.
2. Use GPT-2, GPT-3, BERT or other Transformer based models to convert code from one programming language to another programming language.
For example convert Python code to equivalent Javascript code, where the output and side effects of functions are identical.
3. Use GPT-2, GPT-3, BERT or other Transformer based models to convert programming language code to binary code(executable) and vice versa(binary code to programming language code)
4. AI RPG where you write or select your actions in english and the game randomly generates a floating point number to indicate the chance of success.  
The random number indicates if the action taken is succesfull or not and the game would alter the story accordingly.  
Text --> ACTION --> RANDOM NUMBER GENERATION --> STORY ALTERATION.  
The game would generate the story with a Transformer based model and present you some choices(generated) of action or you would write your own.
The game would then generate the random number indicating the success represented either in binary ((0, fail), (1, success)) integer/text or more detailed form(float in range between 0 and 1 where the number 1 could represent critical success and 0 critical or deadly failure, 0.5 could represent some form of success 
The sucess rate would be either in integer floating point or text form.  
There could be two ways to implement this:1. Append the random number in number or text form to the action taken and use that as input for the transformer based model and let the transformer generate the outcome. 2. Use the random number in a game system to compute the outcome. 

5. Use IGPT other Transformer based models to generate game images(game props, backgrounds) from the story (text) generated by the transformer based model.
6. Can GPT-2 or other Transformer based models be used to generate a fake dataset?  
I tried to use GPT-2 with the following input:
* NAME:HENRI,AGE:32,LOCATION:GERMANY;NAME:JAMES,AGE:64,LOCATION:MEXICO;
