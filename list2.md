1. Break up an image(with a known class) into many smaller tiles(each tile would be shifted from the previous tile by a certain amount of pixels(defined by the stride value.)
Save every tile into the faiss index(or list) and every tiles class into a list or database.
Repeat this for every image in a dataset.
When classifying an image break up the image into many smaller tiles(where every tile is shifted from the previous).
Take the tile first tile from the image and similarity search for the most similar tile in the faiss index. When the most similar tile is found save the (found) tiles known class and similarity value into a list if the similarity value is less zero or less than a treshold(hyper-parameter) value then either the similarity value will be set to zero or the tile/patch wont have a class, if a tile has/belongs to multiple classes then get either all the classes it belongs to or just a few, the tile will have multiple similarity values for each class it belongs to. (tldr. we will classify every tile of the image). Repeat for every tile in the image(until the last tile is classified). We ge an array/list of regions which have a class or multiple classes.(a list(or image) where every region is classified).
Now for each found class in the list we summ up its similarity values, then the class with the highest value represent the class our image belongs to(We can now tell to which class the whole image belongs). And we know which part of the image belongs to a certain class or classes.
